# R has great documentation

Are you wondering how you should ever remember all of the different R commands and how to use them? Fear not! R and RStudio have a number of ways to make your life easier. 

## Accessing function documentation

The `Help` panel in RStudio gives you direct access to all the documentation of all R functions that you have installed. You can search in the search box there, or type `?mysterious_function` in the console. However, my favorite way to assess the help is to put the cursor on the function name and press <kbd>F1</kbd> (similarly, you can use <kbd>F2</kbd> to access the source code for anything -- It is open source, after all!).

Having documentation easily available right in RStudio helps to learn the basics quickly and stay in the flow while you code. It's also worth mentioning that R's Function documentation, package vignettes and package websites are usually well-written and comprehensive.

## Auto-completion 

If you can't quite remember the function name, RStudio will try to assist you with its excellent fuzzy auto-completion that suggests functions while you type. Use <kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>↓</kbd>, and <kbd>↹</kbd> to select one of the choices.

## Cheat sheets

There are excellent [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for popular packages available in the RStudio menu (`Help > Cheatsheets > ...`)

## Finding help online

If you ever run into a problem or an error message that you can't figure out yourself, check Google, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/), or the Twitter `#RStats`. There are also lots of blogs with tutorials written by other R users.
