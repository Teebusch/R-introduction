# R has great documentation

Are you wondering how you should ever remember all of the different R commands and how to
use them? Fear not! R and RStudio have a number of ways to make your life easier.

## Accessing function documentation

The `Help` panel in RStudio gives you direct access to the help files of all R functions
that you have installed. You can search in the search box there, or type
`?mysterious_function` in the console. However, my favorite way to assess the help is to
put the cursor on the function name and press <kbd>F1</kbd> (similarly, you can use
<kbd>F2</kbd> to access the source code for anything -- It is open source, after all!).

Having documentation easily available right in RStudio helps to learn the basics quickly
and stay in the flow while you code. It's also worth mentioning that R's Function
documentation, package vignettes and package websites are usually well-written and
comprehensive.

Look at the help file for the `mean()` function, see what other arguments the function
accepts. How would you calculate a trimmed mean?

::: {.answer}
To get the 10% trimmed mean of a numerical vector x, you can run `mean(x, trim = 0.1)`.
This will remove 10% of the lowest observations and 10% of the highest observations before
calculating the mean. For example:

```{r}
mean(c(-1000, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 20, 1000), trim = .1)
```

## Auto-completion

If you can't quite remember the function name, RStudio will try to assist you with its
excellent fuzzy auto-completion that suggests functions while you type. Use <kbd>↑</kbd>,
<kbd>↓</kbd>, and <kbd>↹</kbd> to select one of the choices.

## Cheat sheets

There are excellent [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for
popular packages available in the RStudio menu (`Help > Cheatsheets > ...`)

::: {.exercise}
Have a look at the cheat sheet for the RStudio IDE and find out how to search and replace
code in RStudio.

## Finding help online

If you ever run into a problem or an error message that you can't figure out yourself Google your problem. SOmeone else probably ran into a similar thing before.  
You can find also lots of blogs with tutorials written by other R users. [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) aggregates many of them. Also check out the searchable database of ["R Posts you might have missed"](https://alastairrushworth.github.io/searchable/searchable.html)

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), [RStudio
Community](https://community.rstudio.com/), or the R mailing are full of people asking and answering questions about R, and you are welcome to ask your questions there.
