# It's easy to get started

Download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), or give it a spin at
[rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). That's it! Everything else you need
can be set up from within RStudio.

*Well, actually ...*

For some things, e.g., Bayesian statistic, you might also need to install
[RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). RTools provides
additional tools that don't come with the standard R installation, such as a
C/C++ compiler. However, you can always do that later.

For reproducible research, you should also install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
RStudio has a Git GUI built in, but personally I prefer [Github
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). We will talk a bit about Git later, but
it really deserves its own 90 minutes introduction, so we will keep it brief.

For maximum reproducibility you could install Docker so that you can create an
RStudio [Docker container](https://www.rocker-project.org/) for each project,
but that is way beyond the scope of this intro.

## Why use RStudio?

[**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is a popular
*all-in-one* user interface (Integrated Development Environment, *IDE*) for
**R**. It provides many conveniences that make working with R easier. There are
alternatives to RStudio, but **R's own GUI** is not one of them:

*R's own GUI --- The 90s called...they want their user interface back.*


## **Hands-on.** First steps with RStudio

### Create a new project

Open RStudio and *create a new RStudio project* in an empty folder. This is the
first thing you should do for every project and the first step towards
reproducibility: Every new R project gets it's own folder in which all its data
and files will live. If you ever move this folder to a new location or share it
with someone else, nothing will break.

Leave *"Use version control"* and *"use renv"* unchecked for now -- we will get
back to those later.

### Operators

In the *console*, try out some of R's operators. R has all the operators that
you would expect to find in a pocket calculator:

  - *arithmetic:* `+ - * / ^`
  - *modular arithmetic:* `%% %/%`
  - *relational:* `< > <= >= == !=`
  - *logical:* `&& || ! | &`
  - *parentheses for modifying precedence:* `(1 + 2) * 10`

Give them a spin and see what happens. For example, what does `1 != 1.0` do? Use
<kbd>Enter</kbd> to run commands, use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to recall
previous commands. And don't worry -- you can't hurt R, it has been through this
before...

### Create a script

The console is useful to run quick throwaway commands but code that you want to
keep belongs in a script file. R sripts still allow a very flexible console-like
workflow, because you can run individual sections or lines as you please.

*Create a script file*, type a few commands and run lines or sections using
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the buttons on the top right of the script
panel.
