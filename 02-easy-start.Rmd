Getting R to run on your computer is usually a relatively smooth
experience[^easy-start-1]: Download and install the latest version of **R**
([https://r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)) and **RStudio**
([https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)) for
your operating system. If you already have either program installed on your computer,
there is no need to uninstall the old versions beforehand.

[^easy-start-1]: It can be more complicated if you are working on a machine with restricted
    permissions, for example a computer issued to you by your employer. If you are in a
    situation like this, and you are experiencing problems with the installation, please
    contact your IT department to sort it out.

If you cannot or do not want to install anything on your machine, you can instead make an
account at **RStudio Cloud** (<https://rstudio.cloud/>). This lets you to use R and
RStudio in the browser. You can use RStudio Cloud for free for a few hours each month. For
the purpose of working through this book that should be enough.

That's it! Everything else you need can be set up from within RStudio.

**Additional Software**

If you are using Windows, you might eventually also have to install **RTools**
(<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>). This includes additional tools, such
as a C/C++ compiler, that you will need for things like Bayesian statistics.

For reproducible research, you should also install **Git** (<https://git-scm.com/>), a
version control system which we will briefly talk about later. For now, you do not have to
worry about these things, because you can always do them later.

Use one of the methods suggested above to get access to R and RStudio so you are ready to
follow along for the rest of the book.

## Why RStudio?

You might be wondering what RStudio is and why we need it. RStudio is a popular
**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** for R. It is an *all-in-one* user interface
that provides many conveniences that make working with R a lot easier. To use an analogy:
If R were a horse, RStudio would be a saddle to sit in. You don't need it, but it makes
things more comfortable. There are good alternatives to RStudio, but R's own GUI is not
really one of them:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R's own GUI --- The 90s called, they want their user interface back.", fig.alt="A screenshot of RGui"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-gui.jpeg")
```

## Create a new RStudio project

Alright cowboy, let's saddle that horse! ðŸ¤ 

The first step you should do whenever you start a
new data analysis project with RStudio is to create an **RStudio project** in a new folder. 
This is the first step towards reproducibility: All of your project's data and files will 
be stored in this folder. If you ever move the project folder to a new location or share 
it with someone else, all of the files will move along with it, reducing the chance that 
things will break. Another benefit of using projects is that it helps you to keep your work 
organized. It will be much easier for you to switch between projects or get back to a project 
you haven't touched in a while.

::: {.exercise}
Open RStudio, go to `File â–¸ New Project...` and create a new RStudio project in an empty
folder. Leave *Use version control* and *Use renv* unchecked for now --- we will get back
to those later.
:::

Now that we have our project set up, let's have a look around RStudio. The many panels and
tabs in RStudio may be overwhelming at first, but I promise this gets better over time,
and most of them are actually quite helpful. The console, for example, allows you to
interact with R directly.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RStudio's user interface with the four panels", fig.alt="A screen capture of the RStudio user interface"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-layout.gif")
```

## Using R as a calculator

In the **console** you can type commands and when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, R will try
to interpret them. You can use <kbd>â†‘</kbd> and <kbd>â†“</kbd> to cycle through previous
commands and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>â†‘</kbd> to search through previous
commands.

Let's get familiar with the console by trying some of R's mathematical **operators**. R
has all the operators that you would expect to find in a pocket calculator:

|                                      |                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Arithmetic                           | `+ - * / ^`       |
| Modular arithmetic                   | `%% %/%`          |
| Relational                           | `< > <= >= == !=` |
| Logical                              | `&& || ! | &`     |
| Parentheses for modifying precedence | `(1 + 2) * 10`    |

It also has all the **functions** you would expect to find in a calculator. Functions are
written as the function name followed by the function's argument in parentheses. For
example, for calculating the square root of 2, use `sqrt(2)`. If a function has multiple
arguments they will be divided by commas, as in `log(2, 10)`. 

::: {.exercise}
In the *console*, try out some of R's operators and see what happens. For example,

1.  What does `1 != 1.0` do?

2.  What happens if you run an incomplete command like `1 *`

3.  What happens if you run a command that does not make sense, like `1*/ 3`

::: {.answer}
1.  R checks whether the argument on the left side (`1`) is *not equal* to the argument on
    the right (`1.0`). It returns `FALSE` because to R these two numbers are identical.

2.  R waits for you to finish the command. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to terminate the
    incomplete command.

3.  R throws an error message and tries to tell you what went wrong. If you are working
    with R, you will have to get used to getting lots of error messages.

```

## Create a script

The console is useful for running quick throw-away commands, and sometimes that's all you
need. However, code that you want to keep should be stored in a **script**. We will use a
special type of script, called an **RMarkdown Notebook**. This format allows you to mix
code and the output it generates with text. The text can be formatted with a special
syntax to create headings, footnotes, links, and more. This allows you to keep your notes
and your code together and is great for writing reproducible documents. In fact, this
entire book was written with *RMarkdown*.

::: {.exercise}
Go to `File â–¸ New File â–¸ R Notebook` to create a new RMarkdown Notebook and save it in
your project's working directory as `analysis.Rmd`. Note that the file has appeared in
RStudio's `Files` tab, which shows you the content of your project folder.
:::

The new notebook already contains some example content. You can see that there is R code
that is written inside special blocks, called **code chunks**. You can create new code
chunks with the green button on the top right of the script panel or with the keyboard
shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd>/<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>

R scripts still allow a flexible console-like workflow because you can run individual
sections or lines of code in any order. You can...

-   **run an entire code chunk** by clicking the green arrow on the right of the chunk.
-   **run individual lines or sections of code** by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
    <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the buttons on the top right of the script panel.

::: {.exercise}
Add a new *code chunk* to your R Markdown Notebook in which you calculate the square of
`2021` as well as the square root of `1764`. Then run the chunk.

::: {.answer}
The code chunk in `analysis.Rmd` should look like this.

    ```{r}`r ''`
    2021^2
    sqrt(1764)
    ```

When you run the chunk, the output should be

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
2021^2
sqrt(1764)
```
