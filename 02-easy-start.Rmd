# It's easy to get started

Download and install the latest version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), or give it a spin at [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). That's it! Everything else you need can be set up from within RStudio.[^easy-start-1]

[^easy-start-1]: For some things, e.g., Bayesian statistic, you might also need to install [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). RTools provides additional tools that don't come with the standard R installation, such as a C/C++ compiler. For reproducible research, you should also install [Git](https://git-scm.com/). RStudio has a Git GUI built in, but personally I prefer [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). We will briefly talk about Git later, but it really deserves its own workshop. For maximum reproducibility you could install Docker, so that you can create an RStudio [Docker container](https://www.rocker-project.org/) for each project, but that is way beyond the scope of this intro. For now, you do not have to worry about these things, because you can always do them later.

## Why use RStudio?

[**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is a popular *all-in-one* user interface (Integrated Development Environment, *IDE*) for R. It provides many conveniences that make working with R easier. To use an analogy: If R were a horse, RStudio would be a very comfortable saddle to sit in. There are alternatives to RStudio, but R's own GUI is not one of them:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R's own GUI --- The 90s called...they want their user interface back.", fig.alt="A screenshot of RGui"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-gui.jpeg")
```

## Create a new RStudio project

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The R Studio layout with it's many panels and tabs may be overwhelming at first, but I promise this gets better over time.", fig.alt="A screen capture of the RStudio user interface"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-layout.gif")
```

Alright cowboy, let's saddle that horse! The first step you should do whenever you start a new data analysis project with R is to create a new project folder. This is the first step towards reproducibility: All of your project's data and files will be stored in this folder. If you ever move this folder to a new location or share it with someone else, all of the files will move along with it and nothing will break.

::: {.exercise}
Open RStudio, go to `File ▸ New Project...` and create a new RStudio project in an empty folder. Leave *Use version control* and *Use renv* unchecked for now --- we will get back to those later.

### Operators

R has all the operators that you would expect to find in a pocket calculator:

|                                      |                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Arithmetic                           | `+ - * / ^`       |
| Modular arithmetic                   | `%% %/%`          |
| Relational                           | `< > <= >= == !=` |
| Logical                              | `&& || ! | &`     |
| Parentheses for modifying precedence | `(1 + 2) * 10`    |

::: {.exercise}
In the *console*, try out some of R's operators and see what happens. For example, what does `1 != 1.0` do? Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run commands, use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to recall previous commands.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Don't worry -- you can't hurt R, it has been through this before...", fig.alt="Hello Operator Meme"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/operator-meme.jpeg")
```

### Create a script

The console is useful for running quick throw-away commands, and sometimes that's all you need. However, code that you want to keep should be stored in a script file. R scripts still allow a flexible console-like workflow: You can run individual sections or lines in a script in any order by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the buttons on the top right of the script panel.

::: {.exercise}
Create a script file and save it in your project's working directory, then type and run a few commands. What happens if you run `list.files()`?
