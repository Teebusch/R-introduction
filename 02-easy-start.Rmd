Getting R to run on your computer is usually a relatively smooth experience: Simply
download and install the latest version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) for your operating system. If you
already have either program installed on your computer, there is no need to uninstall the
old versions beforehand. If you'd rather not install anything on your machine, you can
instead make an account at [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) and use R and RStudio
in the browser. That's it! Everything else you need can be set up from within RStudio.

For some things, e.g., Bayesian statistic, you might also need to install
[RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). RTools provides additional tools
that don't come with the standard R installation, such as a C/C++ compiler. For
reproducible research, you should also install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), which we will
briefly talk about later. For now, you do not have to worry about these things, because
you can always do them later.

Use one of the methods suggested above to get access to R and RStudio so you can follow
along for the rest of the book.

## Why RStudio?

You might be wondering what RStudio is and why we need it. RStudio is a popular
*all-in-one* user interface (Integrated Development Environment, *IDE*) for R. It provides
many conveniences that make working with R a lot easier. To use an analogy: If R were a
horse, RStudio would be a saddle to sit in. You don't need it, but it makes things more
comfortable. There are some alternatives to RStudio, but R's own GUI is not really one of
them:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R's own GUI --- The 90s called...they want their user interface back.", fig.alt="A screenshot of RGui"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-gui.jpeg")
```

## Create a new RStudio project

Alright cowboy, let's saddle that horse! The first step you should do whenever you start a
new data analysis project with RStudio is to create a new project folder. This is the
first step towards reproducibility: All of your project's data and files will be stored in
this folder. If you ever move this folder to a new location or share it with someone else,
all of the files will move along with it and nothing will break.

Another benefit of using projects is that it helps you keep your work organized. It will
be much easier for you to switch between projects, or get back to a project you haven't
touched in a while.

::: {.exercise}
Open RStudio, go to `File ▸ New Project...` and create a new RStudio project in an empty
folder. Leave *Use version control* and *Use renv* unchecked for now --- we will get back
to those later.
:::

Now that we have our project set up, let's have a look around RStudio.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RStudio's user interface", fig.alt="A screen capture of the RStudio user interface"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-layout.gif")
```

The many panels and tabs in RStudio may be overwhelming at first, but I promise this gets
better over time, and most of them are actually really helpful. The console, for example,
allows you to directly interact with R. You can type commands in there and when you press
<kbd>Enter</kbd>, R will try to interpret them.\
You can use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to cycle through previous commands and
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd> on Mac to
search through previous commands.

### Using R as a calculator

Let's get familiar with the console by trying some of R's mathematical operators. R has
all the operators that you would expect to find in a pocket calculator:

|                                      |                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Arithmetic                           | `+ - * / ^`       |
| Modular arithmetic                   | `%% %/%`          |
| Relational                           | `< > <= >= == !=` |
| Logical                              | `&& || ! | &`     |
| Parentheses for modifying precedence | `(1 + 2) * 10`    |

It also has all *functions* you would find in a calculator. Functions are written as the
function name followed by the function's argument in parentheses. For example, for
calculating the square root of 2, use `sqrt(2)`.

::: {.exercise}
In the *console*, try out some of R's operators and see what happens. For example,

1.  What does `1 != 1.0` do?

2.  What happens if you run an incomplete command like `1 *`

3.  What happens if you run a command that does not make sense, like `1*/ 3`

::: {.answer}
1.  R checks whether the argument on the left side (`1`) is *not equal* to the argument on
    the right (`1.0`). It returns `FALSE` because to R these two numbers are identical.

2.  R waits for you to finish the command. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to terminate the
    incomplete command.

3.  R throws an error message and tries to tell you what went wrong. If you are working
    with R, you will have to get used to getting lots of error messages.

knitr::include_graphics("images/operator-meme.jpeg")
```

### Create a script

The console is useful for running quick throw-away commands, and sometimes that's all you
need. However, code that you want to keep should be stored in a script file. R scripts
still allow a flexible console-like workflow: You can run individual sections or lines in
a script in any order by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the buttons on the
top right of the script panel.

::: {.exercise}
Create a script file and save it in your project's working directory as `script.R`. Note
how the file has appeared in RStudio's `Files` tab, which shows you all the files in your
project folder. Modify your script so that it calculates the square of `2021` as well as
the square root of `1764` and run it.

::: {.answer}
```{r eval=FALSE}
# script.R

2021^2
sqrt(1764)
```
