# What is R? {#what-is-r .unnumbered}

R is a *statistical computing and data analysis environment.* It is a free and open source
implementation of the [**S**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language))
programming language, which was created in the 1970s with interactive data analysis in
mind. Here's what that means:

-   **R is free and open source** -- R is owned and developed by the community of its
    users. This has led to a rich and continually evolving ecosystem of freely available
    extensions (*packages*) for R that cover many fields and applications.

-   **R is interactive** -- R works like a pocket calculator that allows you to do
    calculations, explore data, and analyse data quickly and on the fly. It allows for a
    very flexible, interactive workflow that is especially well suited for data
    exploration and analysis.[^what-is-r-1]

-   **R is focused on data analysis** -- Right out of the box, R gives you a powerful tool
    belt for data analysis. More than in many other programming languages, data and
    statistics are at the core of R and there are built-in data structures and functions
    that make data analysis easier.

[^what-is-r-1]: This workflow is not unique to R. Python, for example, offers similar
    functionality via the *iPython* (interactive Python) project.

Although R is a proper programming language[^what-is-r-2], its main focus is undoubtedly
data analysis. So much so, that some people call R a [domain
specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) programming language.
Others say that R is [an environment for interactive data analysis that *has* a
programming language](https://youtu.be/6S9r_YbqHy8).

[^what-is-r-2]: Some people claim that you can use [R for
    everything](https://youtu.be/m6nUdoP6894).

## A tool for data analysis {.unnumbered}

R is popular in academia, industry, and the public sector as a tool for data
analysis,[^what-is-r-3] where it is used to support all parts of the data analysis
workflow, and throughout this book we will get a glimpse of how R can help you with all of
these steps:

[^what-is-r-3]: In 2020, R even briefly climbed to the 8th place of the TIOBE index, which
    ranks programming languages by how *in-demand* they are
    (<https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/>).

```

-   **Data collection** --- This involves obtaining the data from its source, for example,
    a spreadsheet, a database, the output of another software, or the log files of a
    measurement device.

-   **Data wrangling** --- This includes tasks like cleaning, transforming, and
    summarizing the data, merging data sources, dealing with odd data points, and
    calculating new variables. This part of the data analysis workflow is also known as
    *data munging*, or *"80% of data science".*

-   **Data Visualization** --- This involves turning the data into visual representations,
    for exploration, explanation, or exhibition.

-   **Modeling** --- This is all about applying models to your data in order to understand
    it better (e.g. clustering) and often with the goal to make predictions. This includes
    relatively common statistical models and tests (such as the general linear model) and
    more advanced machine learning techniques like deep neural networks.

-   **Communication** --- This is about communicating the analysis, for example in the
    form of a report, a manuscript, a presentation, or a web interface, and doing it in a
    way that is transparent and reproducible.
