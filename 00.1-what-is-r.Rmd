# What is R? {#what-is-r .unnumbered}

You wouldn't be reading this if you didn't already have some idea what R is, but I think
it will be useful to briefly discuss this anyways. R is a *statistical computing and data
analysis environment* that is widely used in academia, industry, and the public
sector.[^what-is-r-1] It is a free and open source implementation of the
[**S**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)) programming language,
which was created in the 1970s with interactive data analysis in mind. Here's what that
means:

[^what-is-r-1]: In 2020, R even briefly climbed to the 8th place of the TIOBE index, which
    ranks programming languages by how *in-demand* they are
    (<https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/>).

-   **R is free and open source** -- R is owned and developed by the community of its
    users. This has led to a rich and continually evolving ecosystem of freely available
    extensions (*packages*) for R that cover many fields and applications.

-   **R is interactive** -- R works like a pocket calculator that allows you to do
    calculations, explore data, and analyse data quickly and on the fly. You can execute
    commands individually and in any order and store and retrieve data in R's memory as
    you go. This allows for a very flexible, interactive workflow that is especially well
    suited for data exploration and analysis.[^what-is-r-2]

-   **R is focused on data analysis** -- Right out of the box, R gives you a powerful tool
    belt for data analysis. More than in many other programming languages, data and
    statistics are at the core of R and there are built-in data structures and functions
    that make data analysis easier.

[^what-is-r-2]: This workflow is not unique to R. Python, for example, offers similar
    functionality via the *iPython* (interactive Python) project.

## A tool for data analysis {.unnumbered}

Although R is a proper programming language[^what-is-r-3], its main focus is undoubtedly
data analysis. So much so, that some people call R a [domain
specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) programming language.
Others say that R is [an environment for interactive data analysis that *has* a
programming language](https://youtu.be/6S9r_YbqHy8). In any case, R is a powerful
*one-stop-shop* for the whole data analysis workflow:

[^what-is-r-3]: Some people claim that you can use [R for
    everything](https://youtu.be/m6nUdoP6894).

```

-   **Data collection** --- This involves obtaining the data from its source, for example,
    a database, the output of another software, or the logfiles of a measurement device.

-   **Data wrangling** --- This part of the data analysis workflow is also known as *data
    munging*, or *80% of data science.* It involves cleaning and transforming the data,
    dealing with odd data points, adding new variables.

-   **Data Visualization** --- This involves turning the data into visual representations,
    for exploration, explanation, or exhibition.

-   **Modeling** --- Applying models to your data, in order to understand it better (e.g.
    clustering) and usually with the goal to make predictions. This includes relatively
    common statistical models and tests (such as the general linear model) and more
    advanced machine learning techniques like deep neural networks.

-   **Communication** --- Communicating the analysis in the form of a report, a
    manuscript, a presentation or an email, and ding it in a way that is transparent and
    reproducible.

Throughout this book we will get a glimpse of how R can help you with all of these steps.
