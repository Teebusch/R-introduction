# What is R? {#what-is-r .unnumbered}

You wouldn't be reading this if you didn't already have some idea what R is, but I think
it will be useful to briefly discuss this anyways. R is a *statistical computing and data
analysis environment* that is widely used in academia, industry, and the public
sector.[^what-is-r-1] It is a free and open source implementation of the [programming
language S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was created in
the 1970s with interactive data analysis in mind. Here's what that means:

[^what-is-r-1]: In 2020, R even briefly climbed to the 8th place of the TIOBE index of
    *in-demand* programming languages (<https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/>).

-   **R is free and open source** -- R is owned and developed by the community of its
    users. This has led to a rich and continually evolving ecosystem of freely available
    extensions (*packages*) for R that cover many fields and applications.

-   **R is interactive** -- R works like a fancy pocket calculator that allows you to do
    calculations, explore data, and analyse data quickly and on the fly. You can execute
    short snippets of code individually and in any order and store and retrieve data in
    R's memory as you go. This allows for a very flexible, interactive workflow that is
    especially well suited for data exploration and analysis.[^what-is-r-2]

-   **R is focused on data analysis** -- Right out of the box, R gives you a powerful tool
    belt for data analysis. More than in many other programming languages, data and
    statistics are at the core of R and there are built-in data structures and functions
    that make data analysis easier.

[^what-is-r-2]: This workflow is not unique to R. Python, for example, offers similar
    functionality via the *iPython* (interactive Python) project.

Although R is a proper programming language[^what-is-r-3], its main focus is undoubtedly
data analysis. So much so, that some people call R a [domain specific programming
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). Others say that R is
[an environment for interactive data analysis that *has* a programming
language](https://youtu.be/6S9r_YbqHy8). In any case, R is a powerful *one-stop-shop* for
the whole data analysis workflow:

[^what-is-r-3]: Some people claim that you can use [R for
    everything](https://youtu.be/m6nUdoP6894).

-   Data collection

-   Data wrangling[^what-is-r-4]

-   Data Visualization

-   Modeling

-   Communication

[^what-is-r-4]: This part of the data analysis workflow involves data cleaning and
    transformation and is also known as *data munging*, or *80% of data science.*
