A great reason for choosing R over commercial software packages is that it is is *free and
open source software (FOSS)*. This means that nobody can ever own any exclusive rights to
R. Anyone can obtain a copy of R for free and modify it however they like. The license
under which R is published guarantees that it will stay like that forever.

Being **free** means that there are no software license fees or purchasing costs. This
means lower cost and less bureaucracy! It means that you can use R everywhere, and you can
use any version of it at any time. This is great for collaboration, sharing, and
reproducibility.

Being **open source** means that nobody can decide to stop the development of R. Moreover,
if anything is missing, R users can create it themselves, and --- as we will see later ---
they do! There are tens of thousands of extensions (*packages*) for R that were created by
the R community and are free for everyone to use.

Finally, being free an open source means that you can simply give R a spin and see if it's
for you --- no strings attached!

## Is R reliable?

Make no mistake: Free and open source does not mean unprofessional! The R project is very
stable, and there is a core team of computer scientists and statisticians guiding its
development. While a lot of the improvements to R are contributed by volunteers, the
project does receive financial support

-   *directly* from companies such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and
    [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), who employ developers to improve R, and

-   *indirectly* through people who contribute to the R project as part of their jobs
    (e.g., research software engineers, statisticians, data scientists).

There are also peer-reviewed journals such as the [*Journal of Statistical
Software*](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) and the R project's own [*R
Journal*](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2020-2/), which academics can use to get
credit for working on R-related things. It's also common to see papers in other journals
introducing new statistical methods alongside an implementation in R.
