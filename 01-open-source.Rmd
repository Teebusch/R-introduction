# R is free and open source

-   What is free and open source software (FOSS)?

A great reason for choosing R over commercial software packages is that it is is *free and
open source software (FOSS)*. That means there are no software license fees or purchasing
costs, and the license under which R is published guarantees that it will stay like that
forever. That is, nobody can ever own any exclusive rights to R, decide to stop the
development of R, or force you to pay for R.

Being **free** means lower cost and less bureaucracy! It means that you can use R
everywhere, and you can use any version of it at any time. This is great for
collaboration, sharing, and reproducibility.

Being **open source** means that if anything is missing, R users can create it themselves,
and --- as we will see later --- they do! There are tens of thousands of for R that were
created by the R community and are free for everyone to use.

Make no mistake: Free and open source does not mean unprofessional! The R project is very
stable, and there is a core team of computer scientists and statisticians guiding its
development. Financially, the project is supported

-   *directly* by companies such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and
    [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), who employ developers to improve R, and

-   *indirectly* through people who contribute to the R project as part of their jobs
    (e.g., research software engineers, statisticians, data scientists).

There are also peer-reviewed journals such as the [*Journal of Statistical
Software*](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) and the R project's own [*R
Journal*](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2020-2/), which academics can use to get
credit for working on R-related things. It's also common to see papers in other journals
introducing new statistical methods alongside an implementation in R.

Finally, being free an open source means that you can simply give R a spin and see if it's
for you --- no strings attached! So let's do that right now...
