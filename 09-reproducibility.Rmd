# R encourages reproducible research

All the steps in your analysis are visible in your script files. While GUI-based workflows are not reproducible, well-written code provides documentation and data provenance. However, you have to make sure your code keeps doing what it does today! R can help you with that in a number of ways!

## Make Self-contained Projects

Organising your project as a self-contained RStudio project was the first step to reproducibility. RStudio Projects are portable, reproducible, self-contained, organized. All the files are where you expect them, and all filenames and paths are relative to the project directory. 

## Snapshot your development environment

R changes quickly, packages get updated frequently, and function interfaces change. It can be really frustrating to find that your analysis from a few months ago suddenly does not run anymore, or that it fails to run on your collaborators computer. 
You can save yourself the trouble by storing a snapshot of your package library using the [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package.

You can take this idea a step further by using [Docker with Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/) - fully reproducible data analysis in a Docker container (virtual machine).

## Use Version control

Version control is like a time machine for your analysis. It is to code what the :floppy_disk: is to a Word document (but better). A popular version control tool is [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git allows you to...

- store the state of your project 
- see changes you or others have made
- create parallel versions (branches) of your code and merge them back together
- restore a previous version of your project
- Safely collaborate with others on the same code
- and more 

RStudio
has a Git GUI built in, but personally I prefer [Github
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 
Git deserves its own 90 minute intro. [Learn to use Git](https://happygitwithr.com/), and use it often!

For maximum reproducibility you could install
Docker, so that you can create an RStudio [Docker container](https://www.rocker-project.org/) for each project, but that is beyond the scope of this intro. 

## Make reports reproducible

In an *RMarkdown* document, you can mix text, R code, and the output of that R code. With the click of a button, you can turn this into a self-contained document (an HTML page, a PDF, a Word file) that you can share with others.

[You can use this to make websites, slides, or even write papers](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). And if a reviewer asks you to exclude a subject? Remove the data point and click the button again --- all the figures and stats update! Without ever leaving RStudio, [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) allows you to make 

- reports 
- papers with [`{papaja}`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja), [`{rticles}`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles)
- books with [`{bookdown}`](https://bookdown.org/)
- websites, blogs with [`{blogdown}`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), [`{hugodown}`](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/), [`{distill}`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)
- slides with [`{xaringan}`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), [`{xaringanthemer}`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer)
- [teaching with {learnR}](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/02_bellCurve.html)
- [RMarkdown with parameters](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-6.html) for simple tools, recurring tasks/reports, ...

## No more copy and paste!

## **Hands-on.** Make your Research Reproducible 

### Use {renv} to store a snapshot of your package library

Install the `{renv}` package, then -- in your project initialize `{renv}` for your project and take a snapshot of the packages you use in your project:

```r 
install.packages("renv")
renv::init()
renv::snapshot()
```

This creates a private, per-project library, in which new packages will be installed. This library is isolated from other R libraries on your system. Later, you or your collaborators can recreate this library, with the exact package versions you used by running `renv::restore()`.

### Take a snapshot of your code with Git

```r
# ...
```

To utilize the full power of Git, you will have to learn a couple more things. However, you can already rest assured, that you can alway go back and see the changes you have made, and where things broke. Isn't that a comforting feeling?
