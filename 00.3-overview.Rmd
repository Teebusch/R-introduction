# The road ahead {.unnumbered}

Now that we know what R is and we have discussed some good alternatives, we will
have a look at what speaks for learning R. There are many good reasons to learn R! In the next
section of the book I will present ten of them, and we will also get hands-on with R. This
is a very superficial introduction and we will skip over some of the details for the sake
of showing you the whole spectrum of what R has to offer and providing you with knowledge
that is practically useful in as little time as possible.

We will use modern R with *RStudio* and the *Tidyverse* (more about that later). This will
help us to focus on data analysis quickly, without worrying to much about some of the more
technical aspects of programming.

## Overview {-}

Here are the 10 things we will look at:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="A hand-written list of 10 reasons to learn R"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/reasons.png")
```

#### 1.  Free and open source {-}

We will learn about free and open source software and why it is great.
    
#### 2.  Easy to get started {-}

We will install R and *RStudio*, setup an *RStudio project*, and start interacting with R in the console and by writing our first script.
    
#### 3.  A flexible language that grows with you {-} 

We will get to know the fundamental data types and data structures of R.
    
#### 4.  Well-documented {-}

We will learn how to get help in R.

#### 5.  Expandable {-}

We will learn how to add additional functions to R by installing packages and we will learn how to load data into R.
    
#### 6.  Powerful data wrangling functions {-}

We will see how to transform data to prepare it for data analysis, join data.

#### 7.  Powerful data visualization functions {-}

We will make a complex statistical graph with just one line of code.
    
#### 8.  Powerful statistical methods {-}

We will run a statistical model with just one line of code.
    
#### 9.  Encourages reproducible research {-}

We will make our analysis reproducible.

#### 10. An awesome community {-}

We will talk about where to find other R users and how to continue learning.


## Conventions {.unnumbered}

### Code formatting  {-}

In the text, names of R packages will look like this: `{tidyverse}`. R code will appear inline like this `print("Hello R!")` or in a box, followed by its output like this:

```{r}
print("Hello R!")
```

### Callout Boxes  {-}

There are three different types of callout boxes:

::: {.goals}
*   At the beginning of each chapter, I will list the things we are going to do and learn. 
*   You can use these to check your prior knowledge 
*   Feel free to skip chapters that won't provide any new insights for you.
:::

::: {.more}
This is an info box. It expands on a learning point and gives you details that
may not be essential but could help you to see the connections between concepts. It is ok to skip these entirely if they are not helping.
:::

::: {.exercise}
This is a challenge. Do these to deepen your understanding. To reveal the solution in the box below, click it.

::: {.answer}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print("This is the solution")
```
:::
:::

### Data is singular {-}

A final point: The word *"data"* will be used as a singular mass noun, as in *"the data looks wonderful"*. I apologize to those whose grammatical intuition this offends. I just can't help it.
