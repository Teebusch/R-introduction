# (PART\*) Ten Reasons to Learn R {.unnumbered}

# About this section {.unnumbered}

Now that we know what R is, and we have discussed some good alternatives to R, we will
have a look at what speaks for learning R. There are many good reasons to learn R! In this
section of the book I will present ten of them, and we will also get hands-on with R. This
is a very superficial introduction and we will skip over some of the details for the sake
of showing you the whole spectrum of what R has to offer and providing you with knowledge
that is practically usefuls in as little time as possible.

We will use modern R with *RStudio* and the *Tidyverse* (more about that later). This will
help us to focus on data analysis quickly, without worrying to much about some of the more
technical aspects of programming.

Here are the 10 things we will look at:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="A hand-written list of 10 reasons to learn R"}

```

1.  **Free and open source** --- We will learn about free and open source software and why
    it is great.
2.  **Easy to get started** --- We will install R and RStudio, setup a project, and start
    interacting with R in the console and by writing our first script.
3.  A flexible language that grows with you --- We will get to know the fundamental data
    types and data structures of R.
4.  **Well-documented** --- We will learn how to get help in R.
5.  **Expandable** --- We will learn how to add additional functions to R by installing
    packages and we will learn how to load data into R.
6.  **Powerful data wrangling functions** --- We will see how to transform data.
7.  **Powerful data visualization functions** --- We will make a complex statistical graph
    with just one line of code.
8.  **Powerful statistical methods** --- We will run a statisical model with just one line
    of code.
9.  **Encourages reproducible research** --- We will make our analysis reproducible.
10. **An awesome community** --- I will talk about where to learn more.

## Conventions {.unnumbered}

::: {.goals}
At the beginning of each chapter, I will list the things we are going to do and learn. You
can use these to check your prior knowledge and decide to skip chapters that won't provide
any new insights for you.
:::

::: {.more}
This is an info box. It expands on a learning point and gives you some information that
may not be essential but could help you to see the connections between concepts.
:::

::: {.exercise}
This is a challenge. Do these to deepen your understanding. Click the answer box to show
it.

::: {.answer}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print("This is the answer.")
