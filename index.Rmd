# (PART\*) Introduction {.unnumbered}

# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book is a short hands-on introduction to R. The goal is to provide a quick overview
of things that are great about R so that you can decide whether diving deeper is worth
your time. We will start with a brief introducing to R, followed by a discussion of good
reasons *not* to learn R and some worthwile alternatives. Then we turn to the things that
R has to offer: I will present ten things that I love about R and along with that, you
will get some hands-on experience.

The book uses modern R, with *RStudio, RMarkdown*, and the *Tidyverse*. It focuses on the
parts that are most essential for reproducible data analysis and keeps the technical
details to a minimum. After reading it, you will have a basic understanding of data
analysis in R and should be able to decide whether you want to continue learning.

## Who is this book for? {.unnumbered}

This book is written for someone who already has some experience with doing data analysis
using other tools but now wants to learn more about R. Your motivation might be that...

-   You are afraid of missing out and want to know what all the fuzz is about

-   You feel that your current workflow isn't reproducible or efficient enough, and you
    believe that R might help you with that

-   There is a statistical method that you would like to use, that is not available in
    your preferred software but it is available in R

-   You unsuccessfully tried to learn R before, but would like to try again

I'm assuming you have no or very little programming experience[^index-1] and you are not
particularly interested in computer programming. You don't want to be bored with technical
background knowledge. You are here, because you want to learn tools that can help you get
things done, and you wonder if R might be one of them.

[^index-1]: If you are a seasoned programmer, there are more efficient ways to catch up on
    R. I recommend the books *R for Data Science* and [*Advanced
    R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html). Both are available for free online.

## The origins of this book {.unnumbered}

This book started as my notes for a workshop I gave in April 2021 at a research group
meeting at the University of Oslo's Department of Special Needs Education. It was a 90
minutes long hands-on introduction to R with the goal to provide an overview of R. After
the workshop, I continued to expand on the material and eventually, it turned into a more
comprehensive introduction to R.

This is book is a result of my passion for teaching R and my interest in the pedagogy of
teaching tech. The pedagogical style is heavily inspired by that of the Carpentries lesson
material, which is presented excellently in Greg Wilson's [*Teaching Tech
Together*](https://teachtogether.tech/). However, in contrast to the Carpentries lessons,
this book progresses faster and its treatment of R is more superficial. It provides a
broader overview of R at the expense of depth.

## About the author {.unnumbered}

I have worked with R and other languages in a research context for almost 10 years and I
have made some humble contributions to the R ecosystem. I teach R as a certified
instructor for [The
Carpentries](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/), and I
help maintain the Carpentries lesson material for the lesson *Data Analysis and
Visualization in R for Ecologists*. I really enjoy teaching researchers to code and I
especially like showing them the marvelous world of R.
