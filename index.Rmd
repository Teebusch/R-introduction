# (PART\*) Introduction {.unnumbered}

# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book is a short hands-on introduction to R. The goal is to provide a quick overview
of things that are great about R so that you can decide whether diving deeper is worth
your time.

We start by briefly introducing the history and purpose of R. Then we discuss compelling
reason *not* to learn R and offer some attractive alternatives. So prepared, we will turn
to the things that R has to offer: the second part of the book presents 10 things that I
absolutely love about R and along with that, you will get some hands-on experience with R.

We will use modern R with *RStudio* and the *Tidyverse*, and we will focus on the parts of
R that are most essential for data analysis. This allows us to focus how to fork with
data, rather than worrying about difficult programming concepts. I will showcase all that
R has to offer, and I hope that this helps you to decide whether it is for you.

## Who is this book for? {.unnumbered}

This book is written for someone who already has some experience with doing research or
data analysis using other tools. I'm assuming you want to learn more about R because...

-   you are afraid of missing out and want to know what all the fuzz is about,

-   you believe that R might help you to be more efficient,

-   you feel that your current workflow isn't reproducible enough,

-   there is a statistical method that you would like to use, that is not available in
    your preferred software but it is available in R, or

-   or you unsuccessfully tried to learn R before, but would like to try again

I'm assuming you have no or very little programming experience[^index-1] and you are not
particularly interested in computer programming. You don't want to be bored with technical
background knowledge. You are here, because you want to learn tools that can help you get
things done, and you wonder if R might be one of them.

[^index-1]: If you are a seasoned programmer, there are more efficient ways to catch up on
    R. I recommend the books *R for Data Science* and [*Advanced
    R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html). Both are available for free online.

## The origins of this book {.unnumbered}

This book started as my notes for a workshop I gave in April 2021 at a research group
meeting at the University of Oslo's Department of Special Needs Education. It was a 90
minutes long hands-on introduction to R. The goal was to provide an overview of R that
could help the workshop participants decide whether they should learn R or not. After the
workshop, I continued to expand on the material and eventually, it turned into a more
comprehensive introduction to R.

This is book is a result of my passion for teaching R and my interest in the pedagogy of
teaching tech. The pedagogical style is heavily inspired by that of the Carpentries lesson
material, which is presented excellently in Greg Wilson's [*Teaching Tech
Together*](https://teachtogether.tech/). However, in contrast to the Carpentries lessons,
this book tries to be a more compact and provide a broad overview of R at the expanse of
depth of understanding.

## About the author {.unnumbered}

I have worked with R and other languages in a research context for almost 10 years during
which I have also made some humble contributions to the R ecosystem. I teach R as a
certified instructor for [The
Carpentries](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/), and I
help maintain the Carpentries lesson material for the lesson *Data Analysis and
Visualization in R for Ecologists*. I really enjoy teaching researchers to code and
introducing them to the many wonders of R.
