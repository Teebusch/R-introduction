# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This book started as the the companion material for a workshop I first held on April 6th, 2021 at the ISP ComPros Research group lunch meeting at the University of Oslo. It was a 90 minutes long hands-on introduction to R. The idea was to provide enough insight to help the audience decide whether they should or should not learn it. After the workshop I kept working on the material and eventually my notes turned into something book-like, so I decided to publish them. This is a living document.

## Who is this for? {.unnumbered}

You are doing research / data analysis with other tools but you are curious about R. Maybe it's because...

-   FOMO - You want to know what all the fuzz is about?
-   You feel that your current workflow isn't efficient, robust, or reproducible enough?
-   There's this *one* R package you would really like to use...?
-   You tried R before and were overwhelmed, but would like to give it a second chance?

Or, you are using R already, but you feel you lost track of all the recent changes and want an update on the state-of-the-Rt?

I'm assuming ...

-   You have no real programming experience
-   You are not particularly interested in computers or programming
-   You want to get things done and you believe that R might help you with that

## Who am I? {.unnumbered}

I have worked with R and other languages (Matlab, Python, ...) professionally in a research context for almost 10 years. I sometimes teach R with [The Carpentries](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/) (usually half/full day courses) and I have made some humble contributions to the R package ecosystem, [`{mifa}`](https://teebusch.github.io/mifa/) and [`{noah}`](https://teebusch.github.io/noah/), and contributed to a few others (e.g, [`{TextGrid}`](https://github.com/patrickreidy/textgRid), [`{rlena}`](https://github.com/HomeBankCode/rlena))

## What is R? {.unnumbered}

R is a statistical computing and data analysis environment that is [widely used](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/) in (bioinformatics, geoscience, digital humanities, ...) and industry (finance, biosciences, pharmacology, ...). It is a free and open source implementation of the [*S* language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was created in the 1970s with *interactive data analysis* in mind. That means:

-   **Interactive** -- R works like a really fancy pocket calculator that lets you make calculations, explore and plot data quickly and "on the fly".
-   **Focussed on Data Analysis** -- More than in many other programming languages, data and statistics are at the core of R. That is, there are built-in data structures and functions that are meant to make data analysis easy.

Some say R is a [domain specific programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). Others say it's [an environment for interactive data analysis that *has* a programming language](https://youtu.be/6S9r_YbqHy8). In any case, R can be a versatile & powerful *one-stop-shop* for the whole data analysis workflow:

-   **Data collection**
-   **Data cleaning & transformation** -- also known as data wrangling, data munging, or "80% of data science"
-   **Data Visualisation**
-   **Modeling** -- using classical statistics as well as machine learning
-   **Communication** -- e.g., in reports, papers, presentations or dashboards

Data analysis is certainly R's core application. However, some people claim that [you can use R for everything...](https://youtu.be/m6nUdoP6894)

## 10 cool things about R {.unnumbered}

![](./images/reasons.png)

There are a lot of good reasons to learn R! Here are the 10 things that I like most about R:

1.  R is free and open source
2.  R is easy to get started
3.  R is a flexible language that grows with you
4.  R is well-documented
5.  R is expandable
6.  R has powerful data wrangling functions
7.  R has powerful data visualization functions
8.  R has powerful statistical methods
9.  R encourages reproducible research
10. R has a truly awesome community

We will have a closer look at all of these, and along the way we will play around with R and do a little hands-on data analysis, but before we start, let's get something out of the way: There are some very good reasons *not* to learn R!


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
