This book is a fast-paced hands-on introduction to R. Its goal is to give you an idea of
what R has to offer, so that you can decide whether diving deeper is worth your time. The
book starts with a brief introducing to R, followed by a discussion of good reasons *not*
to learn R and some worthwhile alternatives. Then we present ten good reasons to learn R
and get some hands-on experience.

The book presents modern R, with *RStudio, RMarkdown*, and the *Tidyverse*. It focuses on
the parts that are essential for reproducible data analysis and keeps the technical
details to a minimum. After reading it, you will know the basics of data analysis in R and
should be able to decide whether you should continue learning.

## Who is this for? {.unnumbered}

The book is written for someone who has some experience doing data analysis with other
tools and wants to learn more about R. Your motivation might be that...

-   You are afraid of missing out and want to know what all the fuzz is about

-   You feel that your current workflow isn't reproducible or efficient enough, and you
    wonder if R could help you with that

-   There is a statistical method that you would like to use, that is not available in
    your preferred software but it is available in R

-   You unsuccessfully tried to learn R before, but would like to try again

I'm assuming you have no or very little programming experience and you are not
particularly interested in computer programming.[^index-1]

[^index-1]: If you are a seasoned programmer, there may be more efficient ways to catch up
    on R than this book. I recommend the books [*R for Data
    Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [*Advanced
    R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html). Both are available for free online.

## The origins of this book {.unnumbered}

This book started as the speaker notes for a workshop I gave in April 2021 at my research
group meeting at the University of Oslo. It was a 90 minutes long hands-on introduction to
R with the goal to provide an overview of R. After the workshop, I continued to expand on
the material and eventually, it turned into a more comprehensive introduction to R.

The book is a result of my passion for teaching R and my interest in the pedagogy of
teaching programming. The pedagogical style is heavily inspired by that of the Carpentries
lesson material, which is presented excellently in Greg Wilson's [*Teaching Tech
Together*](https://teachtogether.tech/). In contrast to a typical Carpentries lessons, the
book skips over some of the details in order to provide a broader overview.

## About the author {.unnumbered}

I have worked with R and other languages in a research context for almost 10 years and I
have made some humble contributions to the R ecosystem. I teach R as a certified
instructor for [The
Carpentries](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/), and I
help maintain the Carpentries lesson material for the lesson *Data Analysis and
Visualization in R for Ecologists*. I really enjoy teaching researchers to code and I
especially like showing them the marvelous world of R.
