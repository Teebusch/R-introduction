# The R community is awesome!

We are almost at the end of this short introduction to R. We barely scratched the surface of what R has to offer. I hope this helped you figure out whether R is for you and of course I hope it made you want to learn more!

If you do want to learn more, I think the best way is to practice and find other people to learn from.

## Engage with the Community

Luckily, R has a friendly, diverse and welcoming community that is very open to beginners. And because it is widespread, there's always an R nerd nearby who's willing to help. Don't be afraid to ask questions, make mistakes, or write bad code! Here are some ideas how you could engage with the community:

- Twitter `#RStats` can help to keep track of all the new things (if you like Twitter ...)
- Participate in [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) to sharpen your data wrangling and data visualization skills and see how other people are approaching the same data
- Read other people's code on Github and co. [Write your own package or contribute to packages.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/make-a-package-make-some-friends/)
- [Join Meetups of R User Groups](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/) or create your own R user group

## Great free learning material

Because R is mainly used by (and taught to) non-computer scientists, there is a lot of learning material for non-techy people. Amazingly, much of it is free *and* really good! The (Awesome R Learning Resources List)[https://github.com/iamericfletcher/awesome-r-learning-resources] provides an extensive list of resources for learning R. Here, I will limit myself to just a few personal recommendations.

I think an excellent place to continue learning would be the [R for Data Science Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which provides a comprehensive overview of the Tidyverse. If you are working in education, then check out [R for Education](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/) -- a handbook for teaching and learning with R and RStudio.

The Carpentries offer beginner R courses for reseachers. The material is available online, e.g., [R for Social Sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) and [R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/). You can also [take a Carpentries R course at UiO](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/)

- [B Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) aggregates a number of R blogs.
