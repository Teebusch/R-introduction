We are almost at the end of this short introduction to R. We have barely scratched the
surface of what R has to offer, but I hope, this has helped you figure out whether R is
for you and whether you want to learn more about R. If you do, I think the best way is to
find other people to learn from.

## Engage with the community

R has an incredibly friendly, diverse, and welcoming community that is very open to
beginners. And because it is widespread, there's always an R nerd nearby who's willing to
help. Don't be afraid to ask questions! Here are some ideas how you could engage with the
community:

-   The Twitter hashtag `#RStats` is a good way keep track of all the new things in the R
    world and "talk shop" with other R nerds.

-   R conferences and user groups are a good place to meet other R users. Jumping rivers
    is maintaining a list. (<https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/index.html>). If
    there is non in your area, why not create your own?

-   [Write your own package or contribute to
    packages.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/make-a-package-make-some-friends/)

## How to keep learning?

Because R is mainly used by (and taught to) people who are not software engineers or
computer scientists, there is a lot of learning material that is made for people without a
technical background. Amazingly, much of it is free *and* really good! I will present just
a few personal recommendations. The [Awesome R Learning Resources
List](https://github.com/iamericfletcher/awesome-r-learning-resources) provides a more
comprehensive list of resources for learning R, and Flavio Azevedo has compiled [a list of
R Tutorials on
YouTube](http://flavioazevedo.com/stats-and-r-blog/2016/9/13/learning-r-on-youtube). R
user groups and conferences also often put their talks online. See, for example, the
[RStudio presentations](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/).

An excellent book to pick up next would be [*R for Data
Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). It provides a comprehensive overview of the Tidyverse.
If you are working in education, then also check out [*R for
Education*](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/) --- a handbook for teaching
and learning with R and RStudio.

There is also a *R for Data Science* learning community that organizes community learning
events such as *Tidy Tuesday* -- a weekly data visualization challenge. Participate in
[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) to sharpen your data
wrangling and data visualization skills and see how other people are approaching the same
data.

Finally, the Carpentries are an organisation that teaches scientific computing skills to
researchers, including R courses for beginners. Many universities and research institutes
offer Carpentries courses for free to their students and employees. The material is
available online, e.g., [R for Social Sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)
and [R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).
