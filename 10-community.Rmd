# The R community is awesome!

We are almost at the end of this short introduction to R. We have barely scratched the
surface of what R has to offer, but I hope, this has helped you figure out whether R is
for you and whether you should learn more. If you do want to learn more, I think the best
way is to practice and find other people to learn from.

## Engage with the community

Luckily, R has a friendly, diverse and welcoming community that is very open to beginners.
And because it is widespread, there's always an R nerd nearby who's willing to help. Don't
be afraid to ask questions, make mistakes, or write bad code!

Here are some ideas how you could engage with the community:

-   The Twitter hashtag `#RStats` is a good way keep track of all the new things in the R
    world and talk shop with other R nerds.

-   [Join Meetups of R User Groups](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/) or create
    your own R user group

-   Conferences such as UseR or RStudio::conf. Often they put their talks online. [RStudio
    presentations](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/)

-   [Write your own package or contribute to
    packages.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/make-a-package-make-some-friends/)

## How to keep learning?

Because R is mainly used by (and taught to) people who are not software engineers or
computer scientists, there is a lot of learning material that is made for people without a
technical background. Amazingly, much of it is free *and* really good! I will present just
a few personal recommendations. The [Awesome R Learning Resources
List](https://github.com/iamericfletcher/awesome-r-learning-resources) provides a more
comprehensive list of resources for learning R. [There is also a list of R Tutorials on
YouTube](http://flavioazevedo.com/stats-and-r-blog/2016/9/13/learning-r-on-youtube).

An excellent place to continue learning R would be the [R for Data Science
Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). It provides a comprehensive overview of the Tidyverse.
There is also a learning community organized around this book and they organize community
learning events such as *Tidy Tuesday* -- a weekly data visualization challenge.
Participate in [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or [Makeover
Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) to sharpen your data wrangling and data
visualization skills and see how other people are approaching the same data

If you are working in education, then also check out [R for
Education](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/) -- a handbook for teaching and
learning with R and RStudio.

The Carpentries are an organisation that teaches scientific computing skills to
researchers. They offer beginner R courses, too. The material is available online, e.g.,
[R for Social Sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) and [R for
Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/). Many universities and research
institutes also offer Carpentries courses for free to their students and employees.
