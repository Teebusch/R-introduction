# The R community is awesome!

We are almost at the end of this short introduction to R. We barely scratched the surface
of what R has to offer. I hope this helped you figure out whether R is for you and of
course I hope it made you want to learn more!

If you do want to learn more, I think the best way is to practice and find other people to
learn from.

## Engage with the community

Luckily, R has a friendly, diverse and welcoming community that is very open to beginners.
And because it is widespread, there's always an R nerd nearby who's willing to help. Don't
be afraid to ask questions, make mistakes, or write bad code! Here are some ideas how you
could engage with the community:

-   Twitter `#RStats` can help to keep track of all the new things and talk shop with other R nerds (if you like Twitter...)
-   [Join Meetups of R User Groups](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/) or create
    your own R user group
-   Conferences such as UseR -- many talks are online. [RStudio
    presentations](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/)

## How to keep learning?

Because R is mainly used by (and taught to) people who are not software engineers or
computer scientists, there is a lot of learning material that is made for people without a
technical background. Amazingly, much of it is free *and* really good! Here, I will limit
myself to just a few personal recommendations. The (Awesome R Learning Resources
List)[<https://github.com/iamericfletcher/awesome-r-learning-resources>] provides a more
comprehensive list of resources for learning R.

If you are working in education, then check out [R for
Education](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/) -- a handbook for teaching and
learning with R and RStudio.

The Carpentries offer beginner R courses for reseachers. The material is available online,
e.g., [R for Social Sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) and [R for
Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/). You can also [take a Carpentries
R course at UiO](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/)

-   [R for the rest of us](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/getting-started/) offers a
    free beginners course.
-   [There are many R Tutorials on
    YouTube](http://flavioazevedo.com/stats-and-r-blog/2016/9/13/learning-r-on-youtube).
    Also check Coursera and other MOOCs for free videos about R.

An excellent place to continue learning R would be the [R for Data Science
Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). It provides a comprehensive overview of the Tidyverse.
There is also a learning community rganized around this book and they organize community
learning events such as Tidy Tuesday -- a weekly data visualization challenge. Participate
in [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or [Makeover
Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) to sharpen your data wrangling and data
visualization skills and see how other people are approaching the same data

Read other people's code on Github and co. [Write your own package or contribute to
packages.](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/make-a-package-make-some-friends/)
