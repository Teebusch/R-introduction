# Why you should *not* learn R {.unnumbered}

Before we look at ten good reasons to learn R, we have to get something out of the way: there are some very good reasons why you should *not* learn R!

## Learning R is a considerable time investment {.unnumbered}

Coding needs practice and R can be challenging to learn.[^why-not-1] Depending on your previous experience with programming and how good you are at thinking like a computer, it will take months or years before you can work efficiently in R. and getting there can---at times---be a frustrating experience. This investment may not be worth it, for example, if you only do a small analysis every once in a while or if your current workflow works well for you.

[^why-not-1]: For examples of R's weirdness, watch John Cook's talk [*The R Language The Good The Bad & The Ugly*](https://youtu.be/6S9r_YbqHy8) and Roger Peng's talk [*Teaching R to New Users: From tapply to Tidyverse*](https://youtu.be/5033jBHFiHE)

## There are good alternatives {.unnumbered}

There are other tools for data analysis, and it's possible that some of them are better suited for your use case.

### Commercial software {.unnumbered}

Commercial software packages for data analysis, such as SPSS, SAS, Stata, and MPlus, often provide excellent customer support and a single, well-documented way to solve a certain type of problem. In contrast, R usually offers a multitude of ways to reach the same goal. While this allows you to choose the tools that suit your needs, this choice can be difficult. Moreover, some commercial tools are the gold standard for certain types of analyses and the exact same methods may not be available in R.[^why-not-2] Commercial software often also guides you on your path through the jungle of statistical tests and models. In contrast, R usually requires a thorough understanding of what your are trying to achieve.

[^why-not-2]: For example, handling missing data with Maximum Likelihood in MPlus is not possible in the equivalent R package, `{MClust}`.

```

### Free software {.unnumbered}

There are also free alternatives to R, that do not require coding. Some of them focus on a particular part of the data analysis workflow, for example, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) and [DataWrangler](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/) for data wrangling, or [RAWgraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/), [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), [DataWrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/), and [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/) for data visualization. Others are comprehensive user interfaces for data analysis who's functionality rivals that of expensive commercial software like SPSS. [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) and [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/), for example, are built on top of R and allow you to utilize much of R's power without writing any R code.

```

### Other programming languages {.unnumbered}

Point-and-click user interface like that of SPSS or Jamovi only work well if you stay within the limits that the developers of these tools had in mind. Programming gives you much more versatility and flexibility,[^why-not-3] and it is certainly a useful skill to have under your belt, even if you end up not using it much. However, R is by no means the only programming language you could choose to learn, for example:

[^why-not-3]: In computer science this is referred to as the [*expressive power*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_power_(computer_science)) of a programming language

-   If you want to learn a language that is more universally useful than R while still being excellent for data analysis, you could have a look at [Python](https://www.python.org/).
-   If you need a language that is equally focused on interactive scientific computing, but more modern and a lot faster, [Julia](https://julialang.org/) might be a better choice.
-   [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), "the language of the web" is is the language of choice if you are interested in building interactive data visualizations, but it is also shaping up to become a serious contender in the data analysis space.[^why-not-4]

## Don't give up just yet! {.unnumbered}

I hope I didn't already discourage you from learning R. Personally, I think R is one of the greatest tool a research or data analyst can have, but I also understand that it's not for everyone. In this book I want to help you decide whether it's for you. Now that we know the alternatives to R, we will have a look at what speaks for learning R. I hope that by the end of this book, you will know whether you should dive deeper into R or not.
