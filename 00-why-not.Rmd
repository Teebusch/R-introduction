# Why you should *not* learn R {-}

*Regardless of what R enthusiasts will tell you, R is not the solution to every
problem.*

## It is a considerable time investment {-}

Coding needs practice! Depending on your previous experience with programming
and your ability to *"think like a computer"*, R can have a steep learning
curve. Even if you are an experienced programmer, R can be weird! For examples,
see [these](https://youtu.be/6S9r_YbqHy8)
[videos](https://youtu.be/5033jBHFiHE).

It will take a while before you can work efficiently in R and getting there can
be a frustrating experience. This frustration may eventually pay off, but if
you, for example, only do a small anaylsis every once in a while it may not be
worth it.

In any case: *"Never change a winning team!"* --- If your current setup works
well for you, don't change it!

## There are good alternatives {-}

### Proprietary Software {-}

Proprietary software like SPSS, SAS, Stata, and MPlus has customer support and
often one recommended way to solve a certain kind of problem. R often has a
multitude of ways to achieve the same goal. While this allows you to choose the
tools that suit your needs, it also can be difficult.

Often, commercial software also does a better job at guiding you on your path
through the jungle of statistical tests and models. R arguably requires a better
understanding of what your are trying to achieve.

*Welcome to R! Here's how you quit...*

Furthermore, some commercial tools are the gold standard for certain types of
analyses and not all methods may be implemented in R. For example, handling
missing data with Maximum Likelihood in MPlus is not possible in the equivalent
R package, `{MClust}`.

### Free point-and-click alternatives {-}

There are also good free alternatives to R that don't require any coding, for
example...

  - Data wrangling with [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) or
    [DataWrangler](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/)
  - Stats with [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) or
    [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/)
  - Data visualisation with [RAWgraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/),
    [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/),
    [DataWrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/), or [Tableau
    Public](https://public.tableau.com/)

:::spoiler *OK, but...* Once mastered, the
[*expressiveness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_power_\(computer_science\))
of programming is unmatched by any point-and-click tool. Moreover, coding is a
valuable skill that is useful to have 'under your belt', even if you end up not
using it much. Learning to code can also be a lot of fun.

#### Other scientific programming languages {-}

If you want a programming language that is more universally useful, you might
want to learn [Python](https://www.python.org/) instead. If you need a language
that is equally focused on interactive scientific computing, but more modern and
faster, [Julia](https://julialang.org/) might be a better choice.
 
:::spoiler *OK, but...* While R is certainly not as popular overall as Python or
as fast as Julia, it is quite popular in the data analysis and research world
and gives you access to a vast amount of amazing third-party tools (packages),
as we will see later. :::
