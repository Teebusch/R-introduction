# What is R? {.unnumbered}

I'm sure you wouldn't be here if you didn't already have some idea what R is, but I think
it's still worthwhile to briefly discuss it. R is a *statistical computing and data
analysis environment* that is [widely used](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/) in
academia, industry, and the public sector. It is a free and open source implementation of
the [S programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)),
which was created in the 1970s with interactive data analysis in mind. Here's what that
means:

-   **R is interactive** -- R works like a really fancy pocket calculator that allows you
    to do calculations, explore data, and analyse data quickly and on the fly.
-   **R is focused on data analysis** -- Right out of the box, R gives you a powerful tool
    belt for data analysis. More than in many other programming languages, data and
    statistics are at the core of R and there are built-in data structures and functions
    that make data analysis easier.

Although R is a proper programming language[^what-is-r-1], data analysis is undoubtedly
its main focus. So much so, that some people call R a [domain specific programming
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). Others say it's [an
environment for interactive data analysis that *has* a programming
language](https://youtu.be/6S9r_YbqHy8). In any case, R can be powerful *one-stop-shop*
for the whole data analysis workflow:

[^what-is-r-1]: Some people claim that you can use [R for
    everything](https://youtu.be/m6nUdoP6894).

-   **Data cleaning & transformation**[^what-is-r-2]
-   **Data Visualization**
-   **Modeling**
-   **Communication**

[^what-is-r-2]: This part of the data analysis workflow is also known as data wrangling,
    data munging, or "80% of data science"
